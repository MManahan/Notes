# Plotly.JS Notes
## Class 1, Activity 1

#### Went over "let", "var" and "const". Setting the "var" AFTER you call the variable returns "undefined". When you do the same thing with  "let", it returns a Reference error. This is because JS "lifts" variables up to the top. 
#### "Const" assignments cannot be re-assigned, but they can still be manipulated if it is an object or array. 

## Class 1, Activity 2

#### Started Plotly.newPlot
#### Set "trace" as a variable to hold the object that will be passed into Plotly.newPlot
#### Plot.newPlot(graphDiv, data, layout)

- graphDiv = the element the plot will be displayed in the html file
- data is the object(trace) that holds, x, y and type of graph. It is expected to be an <b><u>ARRAY</u></b>
- layout adds the attributes of the chart, like title and x&y axis labels

### Example of trace, layout and Plotly.newPlot():
```
var trace1 = {
  x: ["beer", "wine", "martini", "margarita",
    "ice tea", "rum & coke", "mai tai", "gin & tonic"],
  y: [22.7, 17.1, 9.9, 8.7, 7.2, 6.1, 6.0, 4.6],
  type: "scatter"
};
var trace2 = {
  x: ["beer", "wine", "martini", "margarita",
    "ice tea", "rum & coke", "mai tai", "gin & tonic"],
  y: [22.7, 17.1, 9.9, 8.7, 7.2, 6.1, 6.0, 4.6],
  type: "scatter"
};
var data = [trace1,trace2];

var layout = {
  title: "'Bar' Chart"
};

Plotly.newPlot("plot", data, layout);
```
## Class 1, Activity 3

#### var eyeColor was defined as an array of eyeColors. eyeFlicker was defined as an array of flicks. var trace was then defined to set x : eyeColor and y : eyeFlicker with the type : "bar". 
#### layout - title, xaxis and yaxis was defined. x&y axis are defined as objects. 
```
var layout = {
  title: "Eye Color vs Flicker",
  xaxis: { title: "Eye Color" },
  yaxis: { title: "Flicker Frequency" }
};
```
## Class 1, Activity 4

#### Just showed that you can pass multiple traces into data. It will plot both sets of data in the same graph
```
var data = [trace1, trace2];
```

## Class 1, Activity 5

#### Data.js provided data of greek/roman names and search results. Needed to plot the "pair" as the x-axis and greek/roman SearchResults as the y - axis
#### so trace one should be x : "pair" and y : "greek/roman SearchResults"
#### Since data is given as an array of objects, need to use the map function to create an new array for the x and y values we want. *REMEMBER* that the map function creates a new array based on the function that you call on the array. In this case, we just want to get the object value 
- name = sets the trace name. The trace name appears as the legend item when you hover over it. 
- text = sets the text elements that are associated with each x,y pair

## Class 1, Activity 6 

#### Covered slicing of arrays again using their index numbers
```
// Array of names
const names = ["Jane", "John", "Jimbo", "Jedediah"];

// Slices first two names
const left = names.slice(0, 2);
console.log(left);

// Slices last two names and return
const right = names.slice(2, 4);
console.log(right);
```
#### Also covered sort function. The sort function works well for strings. It sorts it alphabetically. 
#### For numeric sorts, you need to use the Compare function(a,b), then set the function to return a-b or b-a depending if you want to sort by ascending or descending order. In this case, a = firstNum, b = secondNum

- DESCENDING Sort
```
// Sorts descending
[3, 2, -120].sort(function compareFunction(firstNum, secondNum) {
   // resulting order is (3, 2, -120) 
  return secondNum - firstNum;
});
```
- ASCENDING Sort
```
// Sorts ascending
[3, 2, -120].sort(function compareFunction(firstNum, secondNum) {
  // resulting order is (-120, 2, 3)
  return firstNum - secondNum;
});

// Arrow Function
[3, 2, -120].sort((first, second) => first - second);
```

## Class 1, Activity 7

#### Covered Horizontal Bar graphs plus the use of sort and accessing data objects values. 
#### We sorted the greekSearchResults data in Descending order by:
```
// Sort the data array using the greekSearchResults value
data.sort(function(a, b) {
  return parseFloat(b.greekSearchResults) - parseFloat(a.greekSearchResults);
});
```
#### The object notation grabs the greekSearchResults value and turns it into a float data type. Initially it was a string. 

## Class 2, Activity 1

#### This activity shows us how to create a drop down option for datasets to plot. What the user sees is the plot and a drop down menu with 4 datasets. The plot.js script initializes the initial graph on load, which is just a line on the x-axis. 
#### The HTML file has a "select" element with option children for each option the user can select. 
```
<select id="selDataset" onchange="getData(this.value)">
    <option>---</option>
    <option value="dataset1">DataSet1</option>
    <option value="dataset2">DataSet2</option>
    <option value="dataset3">DataSet3</option>
  </select>
  ```
#### The on-change this.value gets the value of what the user chose. In this case, there are 3 choices, dataset1, dataset2 and dataset3. This value is then passed into the "getData" function which is coded in plot.js. 
1. The getData function sets an empty array for x and y
2. Then has a switch/case statement to figure out which dataset to use based on the users drop down choice. 
3. It then passes the x and y arrays into the "updatePlotly" function which restyles the plot to show the dataset the user chose. 

## Class 2, Activity 2

#### Same concept as activity 1, just needed to create new datasets for the different options for the user and put them in the switch/case statement. 

## Class 2, Activity 3

#### Using d3.json to get API responses. Need the .then after the promise. 
>A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in >the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that itâ€™s not >resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of >3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can >attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for >rejection.
```
const url = "https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/launchpads";

// Fetch the JSON data and console log it
d3.json(url).then(function(data) {
  console.log(data);
});

// Promise Pending
const dataPromise = d3.json(url);
console.log("Data Promise: ", dataPromise);
```

## Class 2, Activity 4

#### Using d3.json to get an API response from Quandl (stock info)
#### We needed info such as name, stock, startDate, endDate and dates and closing prices from the response, or in this case "data". 
#### Each attribute can be found using the object notation and by looking at the API response. 
#### The unpack function returns an array of values given the row and index you are looking for. 
```
function unpack(rows, index) {
  return rows.map(function(row) {
    return row[index];
  });
}
```
#### In this case, dates is the first column in an array of dates. The closingPrice should be the fourth column according to the helper code, but the solved version has it as index 1. 
```
function buildPlot() {
  d3.json(url).then(function(data) {

    // Grab values from the data json object to build the plots
    var name = data.dataset.name;
    var stock = data.dataset.dataset_code;
    var startDate = data.dataset.start_date;
    var endDate = data.dataset.end_date;
    var dates = unpack(data.dataset.data, 0);
    var closingPrices = unpack(data.dataset.data, 1);
```
#### Then you build your plot off of this data like previous examples. 
```
    var trace1 = {
      type: "scatter",
      mode: "lines",
      name: name,
      x: dates,
      y: closingPrices,
      line: {
        color: "#17BECF"
      }
    };

    var data = [trace1];

    var layout = {
      title: `${stock} closing prices`,
      xaxis: {
        range: [startDate, endDate],
        type: "date"
      },
      yaxis: {
        autorange: true,
        type: "linear"
      }
    };

    Plotly.newPlot("plot", data, layout);
```
